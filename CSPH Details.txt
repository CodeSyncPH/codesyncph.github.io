 About CodeSync.PH

At CodeSync.PH, we're just a bunch of folks who love coding. We're a non-profit group that's all about bringing Filipino programmers together – to learn from each other, grow together, and build cool stuff as a team. It doesn't matter if you're just starting out or you've been at it for years; there's a spot here for you.

We're here to lend a hand, share a laugh, and celebrate every little win on this coding journey. Because at the end of the day, it's not just about the code – it's about the friendships and memories we create along the way.
